# Hyperspectral-Images-Classification-in-Pytorch
Hyperspectral Images Classification in Pytorch - Pavia University

Objective: classification of the hyperspectral images (pavia university map, 103 bands, ~42k pixels)


Notes:
1) I can provide the DB file per request. Is too large to upload here.
2) At this moment, the maximum classification score is 72%. Work ongoing.
3) this code is using parallel GPU computing for training
4) I'm using Pytorch 0.4, Python 3.6, Anaconda 3, all installed in Windows 10
